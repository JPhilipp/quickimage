QuickImage lets you generate AI images using Stable Diffusion 3 and Dall-E 3. You'll need to add your API keys to the .env file, and please note this will add the API costs for each image you create:

    STABILITY_API_KEY=...
    OPENAI_API_KEY=...

To grab the Windows exe, click on Releases and download the zip.

This is an Electron/ Nodejs app saving the images to the images folder, along with a JSON file with further information. When running the Electron app from the command line instead of the Exe, you can also click each resulting image to show its background-removed version. QuickImage comes with a search function over older images. It's a straighforwared and simple way to test StableDiffusion3 and DallE3 to, for instance, work on prompts for game art assets.
